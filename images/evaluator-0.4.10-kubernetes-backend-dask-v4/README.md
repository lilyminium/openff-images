# Creating a Docker image


Here is an example of creating an image and pushing it to GitHub. This image is used for the Evaluator server pod.

```
IMAGE_NAME='evaluator-0.4.10-kubernetes-backend-dask-v3'
docker build --platform linux/amd64 --tag $IMAGE_NAME .
docker tag $IMAGE_NAME "ghcr.io/lilyminium/openff-images:${IMAGE_NAME}"
docker push "ghcr.io/lilyminium/openff-images:${IMAGE_NAME}"
```

The Dockerfile and prepare.sh scripts copy directly from the Dask docker image, which as of this time of writing is BSD-3 licensed.
